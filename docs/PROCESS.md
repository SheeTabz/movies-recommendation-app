# Development Process

This document outlines the development process and key decisions made during the creation of FILMAX.

## üöÄ Project Setup

### Initial Setup
1. **Framework Selection**: Chose Next.js 15 with App Router for modern React development
2. **TypeScript Integration**: Implemented from the start for type safety
3. **Styling**: Selected Tailwind CSS 4 for rapid UI development
4. **API Integration**: Integrated TMDB API for movie data

### Development Environment
```bash
# Project initialization
npx create-next-app@latest movies-recommendation-app --typescript --tailwind --app
cd movies-recommendation-app
npm install axios lucide-react
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### 1. Authentication Strategy
- **Decision**: Client-side authentication with localStorage
- **Reasoning**: Simple implementation for assessment purposes
- **Implementation**: React Context + localStorage for session persistence

### 2. State Management
- **Decision**: React Context + Custom Hooks
- **Reasoning**: Lightweight solution, no need for Redux complexity
- **Implementation**: AuthContext for user state, custom hooks for data fetching

### 3. API Integration
- **Decision**: Service layer pattern with Axios
- **Reasoning**: Separation of concerns, reusable API calls
- **Implementation**: Dedicated service classes in `/src/services/`

### 4. Component Structure
- **Decision**: Atomic design principles
- **Reasoning**: Reusable, maintainable components
- **Implementation**: Components organized by functionality

## üîß Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: TMDB API Integration
**Problem**: Managing API calls and data structure
**Solution**: Created dedicated service layer with TypeScript interfaces

### Challenge 2: Authentication Flow
**Problem**: Implementing authentication without backend
**Solution**: Client-side authentication with localStorage and React Context

### Challenge 3: State Management
**Problem**: Managing movie data and user state
**Solution**: Custom hooks for data fetching and React Context for auth

### Challenge 4: Component Organization
**Problem**: Organizing reusable UI components
**Solution**: Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns

## üìä Performance Optimizations

### Image Optimization
- Next.js automatic image optimization
- Lazy loading for movie posters
- Responsive image sizing

### Code Splitting
- Automatic code splitting with Next.js App Router
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Route-based code splitting

### API Optimization
- Response caching in custom hooks
